This is a simple Space (Asteroids)-style game that I developed over the course of a week. The project started with guidance from Mesos Aurum on youtube and was further refined using Claude AI. It still needs a lot of polishing.

# Controls


WASD - Move the ship


Shift - Boost


F - Shield


Space - Shoot Pellets







# Issues & Planned Improvements

1. The main menu is currently terrible (literally dogshit) and needs visual and functional enhancements.

2. There's no settings system yet volume, controls, and screen resolution are not configurable.

3. When the ship is destroyed, the game closes instantly. There's no "Try Again" or "Back to Menu" screen.

4. When the ship destroys all the rocks, all the player can do is just roam in empty space with no rocks (will fix soon).

5. I’ve had lots of hard times with buttons and UI implementation using SFML 3.0, I'll do my best to improve them soon.
